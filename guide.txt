Create a priority queue to store the information for coats at a store. You must implement it as a heap.

Each coat will have a price and a designer associated with them.
You must have the following:
1 ) A header file called “pq.h” which includes
a ) a coat struct with price and designer variables
b ) a function prototype to add coats to a priority queue
c ) a function prototype to access the most expensive coat in the priority queue
d ) a function prototype to delete the most expensive coat from the priority queue
Note: you may also add any additional functions you would like but they are not necessary
2 ) An implementation file called “pq.cpp” with the functions definitions for all functions created in list.h
3 ) A client file called “client.cpp” which does the following
a ) Ask the user for the information for a coat until the user tells you to stop
b ) Add the coat’s information to the priority queue
c ) Print the information for the 3 most expensive coats
